### WORKING OF WEBSITE  
THE WEBSITE STARTS WITH A HEADER THAT SHOWS THE TITLE "DEVELOPER PORTFOLIO."

IT ALSO INCLUDES A LIST OF SKILLS, SUCH AS FRONTEND TECHNOLOGIES (HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT.JS, AND VUE.JS), BACKEND TECHNOLOGIES (NODE.JS, EXPRESS, MONGODB, AND FIREBASE), AND OTHER TOOLS (GIT, WEBPACK, VS CODE, AND POSTMAN).  
NEXT, THE "PROJECTS" SECTION DISPLAYS SOME OF THE DEVELOPER'S WORK.  
EACH PROJECT HAS AN IMAGE, A SHORT DESCRIPTION, AND A NAME.  
THE LAST SECTION IS "CONTACT," WHERE USERS CAN FIND THE DEVELOPER’S EMAIL, PHONE NUMBER, LINKEDIN, AND GITHUB LINKS.  
AT THE BOTTOM, THERE IS A FOOTER THAT SHOWS COPYRIGHT INFORMATION.
